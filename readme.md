# osm-p2p-db: how

updates written to an append-only log (using hyperlog)

materialized views sit on top of this log:

* hyperkv                 p2p key/value store
* hyperlog-kdb-index      p2p geospatial index

(kappa architecture)

---
# osm-p2p-observations

associate media with 

using hyperdrive

---
# remote data transfer

sneakernet!

* take a usb drive with you when you visit another village
* plug the usb drive into a mapping computer
* take the usb drive back with you

now both computers have the same data

# dd-map-editor

# internet update

```
19:42 < ddem-bot> <gregor> thatâ€™s true. That internet guy Deji actually went out there two 
                  weeks ago and installed a new modem, he was in Shulinab for 3 days testing 
                  and fixing, and kept emailing me with updates. I guess he felt the pressure!
19:43 < ddem-bot> <gregor> They have a new modem now, which apparently is working better, and I 
                  even had a skype conversation with Tessa and it was clear.
